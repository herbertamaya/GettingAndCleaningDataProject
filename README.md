===============================
The purpose of this project is to create a tidy data set from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 [1] which can be used for later analysis. This project was created as part of the course 'Getting and Cleaning Data' offered in Coursera[2].

The files provided are:
========================
-'run_analysys.R': This script contains a function call createTidyDataSet(). Once called, the output of this function wil be a file call 'tidy_data_set.txt' which contains the tidy data set. This function will work properly as long as the package 'dplyr' is already installed, and the Samsung Data is in the working directory.
-'code_book.pdf': Describes the variables in the tidy data set.
